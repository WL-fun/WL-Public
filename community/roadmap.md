## Roadmap

### 2024 Aug, WL Project Started

After two years of Dapp development on the Internet Computer, we decided to incubate a new project that could innovate the industry with the transparent properties of the Internet Computer. Our goal is to create a global application, which led to the creation of World Lottery.

### 2024 Nov, ICP Instant Win Launched

On November 18th, the first lottery game, ICP Instant Win, launched. This initial version is a basic, single-product offering with 10,000 tickets at a price of 0.1 ICP each. Its core functionality is Instant Win determination using a random number seed generated by the Internet Computer. While the team continues to improve this basic version, development has begun on the long-term vision.
